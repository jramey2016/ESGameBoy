# EmbeddedSystemsGameBoy
For this project I had chosen to create a rendition of a classic Gameboy that was preloaded with two games that I have coded. The games can be played using four push buttons. Each one of these buttons would control the spatial movement of a character/sprite on the LCD screen. The premise of the games was quite simple, avoid collisions by navigating the character. If the character does collide with an object a, “Game Over” screen would display, and the user would have to start their progress over. The user could also, complete the games and be rewarded with a simple winning screen. The project was implemented in Atmel studio 7.0 using the Embedded C language.
The LCD Library will need to be downloaded and added to project to be used. Link is included in the source code.
